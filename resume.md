### **Summary**

I had a lot of opportunities but I squandered them (not really, what happens, happens, but it was for the best), but I want to—nay, I will—make them worth the while. If my life story doesn't amaze you, I'll buy you a coffee.

### **Projects**

**[Web-Based Library Tools](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/AppDev1_Library_Management_System)** – Basic Web Frameworks & SQL-based tool

- Python, Web Frameworks, SQL, etc.

**[Automation Agent](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project-1)** – Completes tasks via function calls

- API calling, vector databases, OpenAI function calling and response format, Autogen (deleted repo), CrewAI, among others
- Cutting-edge project—understood how agentic frameworks operate and learned a lot about prompting, LLMs, safeguards, etc.
- Also used CrewAI: [Repo Link](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS-Project1-Ollama_FastAPI-)

**[LLM Microservice](https://github.com/AndrewDavidRatnam/PublicOllamaServiceMicroservice)** – Helps fellow students use LLMs and hosts LLM services on gaming laptops

- API handling and verification using FastAPI, hosted local LLM using Ollama, used tunneling (ngrok, Codespaces open port—this had a timeout though), and streamed responses to other students
- Very basic—couldn't resolve containerizing the Docker images but could run ad-hoc on Codespaces for small responses

**[TDS CLUTCH PROJECT](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS_CLUTCH_PROJECT_1)** – A deep dive into prompting skills

- Used advanced prompt engineering techniques to optimize task automation in LLMs

**[Prompting Paper](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/Paradox_FetchAI/blob/main/Towards%20Autonomous%20Agents_%20A%20Review%20of%20Prompting%20techniques%20to%20increase%20autonomy%20of%20multi-agent%20Systems%20\(2\).pdf)** – Towards Autonomous Agents: A Review of Prompting Techniques to Increase Autonomy of Multi-Agent Systems

**Few other projects but nothing worth mentioning as original**

### **Education**

ICSE\
ISC Commerce\
**BS in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** – Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science\
**IIT Madras**, 2026\
8.6 GPA cumulative (before last term it was 9.2)

---

### **Technical Skills**

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, Shell, C (learning)
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Torch, Jax, Matplotlib, Seaborn, FastAPI, Flask, Web Frameworks, ORM Frameworks, Vector Databases, Agentic Frameworks (Autogen, CrewAI)
- **Tools & Platforms:** SQL
- **Research:** Wrote a review paper on the history of prompting with respect to recent LLMs (2022-2023) and how that plays into agentic frameworks. This actually helped me a lot in understanding prompts. You can check out the [TDS\_CLUTCH\_PROJECT](https://github.com/ANdIeCOOl/TDS_CLUTCH_PROJECT_1) where I use crazy prompt skills.
- **Other Skills:** Will amaze you—just give me a chance. I'm a 25 y/o and in my 3rd year. Please give me a shot, I will impress you.

### **Work Experience**

None

### **Books I Have Read Cover to Cover**

- *Deep Learning* – Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville (except deep learning research part, I skimmed as research was outdated except autoencoders, like Boltzmann machines)
- *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* – Aurélien Géron
- *Calculus* – Tom Apostol (Reading, really awesome but verbose and leans on proof based, will finish this by June) Both 1 and 2
- *Fluid Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications* – Çengel & Cimbala (only till Ch. 14)
- *Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach* – Yunus A. Çengel, Michael A. Boles, Mehmet Kanoğlu (still reading, no time)
- Also few other Dummies series, few papers 
- Introduction to Flight. John Anderson (This book i read while preparing for JEE)
- All jee handbooks and etc XD
- Will definitely keep updating, Chris Bishop , Steve Norvig, Trevor Hastie are in the being read sometimes

### **Achievements & Awards**

The average peaked in high school list.

- Athletics
- Interschool Basketball
- Interschool Chess
- Interschool Fest Office Bearer (I selected people for fests our school participated in.)

---

### **Extracurricular Activities**

In school, I was in chess (U16), basketball, football, and a social activity office bearer. Nothing great, but I did learn what leadership truly was. I didn't display it then, but I understood how I should act in the future.
